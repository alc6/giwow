## üöÄ Getting started

### üì¶ Installation

```shell
$ go install github.com/nicolasdscp/giwow
```
or 

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/nicolasdscp/giwow.git
$ make install
```

### üñ• Setting up your workspace

Choose a folder where your project's workspace will be stored. 
Then init a new workspace.

```shell
$ giwow workspace init my-workspace
```

### üïµüèº‚Äç Working with private repositories

In order to work with private repositories, you need to configure `~/.netrc`.
You can let giwow manage your credentials for you, or you can configure it manually.
If you don't want to configure it manually, you can use the `giwow token add` command.

```shell
$ giwow token add <repo-url>
or
$ giwow token add <repo-url> -u my-user -p my-token
```

This will basically add a new entry to `~/.netrc` with the following content:

```shell
machine <repo-url> login my-user password my-token
```

You can list all your tokens with the `giwow token ls` command.

## üõü Useful commands

If you want to know more about a command, you can use the `giwow [command] -h` command.

```shell
$ giwow prune # Remove all configuration file from all workspaces including $HOME/.giwow
```
